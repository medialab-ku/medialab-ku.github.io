#### Digital human
* An avatar is created by estimating an actorâ€™s pose and shape from the live video, and virtual clothes are put on the avatar so that the clothes are simulated in real time according to the actor's motion.

#### Physics-based simulation
* We investigate simulation techniques that efficiently express various physical phenomena such as deformable bodies, fluids, and collisions between objects.

#### Airflow simulation and visualization
* After reconstructing an indoor space in 3D, we simulate and visualize the airflow from the air conditioners in mobile AR.

#### Wide-area camera tracking and 3D reconstruction
* Tracking the pose of a mobile device in real time using the RGB-D images captured by its camera, we reconstruct the 3D model of a wide area environment.

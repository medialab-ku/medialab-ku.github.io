#### Digital human
* We study technology that creates an avatar by estimating a person's pose and aspect from a live-action video and studies the realization of the natural movement of clothes according to the motion of the avatar.

#### Physics-based simulation
* We study physics-based simulations that efficiently express various physical phenomena such as deformable bodies, fluids, and collisions between objects.

#### Airflow simulation and visualization
* After reconstructing the indoor space in 3D, we study the technology that simulates the airflow generated by the air conditioner and visualizes it in the AR environment.

#### Wide-area camera tracking and 3D reconstruction
* We study technology to track the location of a mobile device in real-time through RGB-D data at an industrial site and to restore a 3D model of the site.

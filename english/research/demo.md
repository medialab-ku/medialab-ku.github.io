#### Digital human
* We study technology that is designed to enable real-time pose estimation and matching from real-time video taken with a smartphone camera, etc., and gives immediate feedback to users. [[video]](https://youtube.com/shorts/b4VUgkE7YC4)

#### Physics-based simulation
* We study physics-based simulations that efficiently express various physical phenomena such as deformable bodies, fluids, and collisions between objects. [[video]](https://youtu.be/mhHivqV7MyM)

#### Airflow simulation and visualization
* After reconstructing the indoor space in 3D, we study the technology that simulates the airflow generated by the air conditioner and visualizes it in the AR environment. [[video]](https://youtu.be/EM6gtB9oueA)

#### Wide-area camera tracking and 3D reconstruction
* We study technology to track the location of a mobile device in real-time through RGB-D data at an industrial site and to restore a 3D model of the site. [[video]](https://youtu.be/yrUf3r8eXWg)
